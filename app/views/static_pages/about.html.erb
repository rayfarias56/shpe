          <h2 class="text-center">The Five Pillars of SHPE</h2>
          <hr>
          SHPE-UIUC focuses on working to instill the five pillars of SHPE within its membership. Our programs and workshops are each related to at least one pillar in the interest of building well-rounded leaders. Below you'll find an explanation of each pillar and some of the things SHPE-UIUC does for each pillar.

          <h3 class="text-center">Academics</h3>
    		  <p>
            As a chapter we are dedicated to academic excellence. Within our chapter there is a culture of tutoring and studying together. We offer open study hours where students can come in and collaborate with fellow SHPE members in reserved library rooms and advisors that help our students choose the classes that will best support them in their chosen career path. It is expected that our upperclassmen make themselves available to other members whenever possible. Many SHPE members also utilize and go on to tutor in the MEPâ€™s facilitated study groups.
          </p> 
        	<h3 class="text-center">Community Outreach</h3>
      		<p>
            Through food drives, park cleaning, Habitat for Humanity trips, and many other events planned by our <%= link_to 'Community Service Committee', community_service_path %> the chapter does its part to strengthen our community. The chapter also tries to promote STEM awareness within the community. We have an ongoing Pen Pal program where undergraduate students write letter to children to expose them to science and engineering. Pen pals have gone on field trips together to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. Also, the chapter, through our 
            <%= link_to 'Outreach Committee', outreach_path %>, hosts High School Visitation days in the fall and the spring which bring students to the University of Illinois to see the campus in order to motivate high school students to go to college.
          </p>
        	<h3 class="text-center">Chapter Development</h3>
        	<p>
            In order to maintain a strong chapter and a sense of familia within our chapter we host General Body Meetings once a month where our Elected board presents information to and fields questions from the general membership. The chapter also has an office in Engineering Hall (<%= link_to 'address', contact_path %>) where our membership can be found eating meals and studying together almost everyday. Furthermore, our MemberSHPE director is in charge of planning socials. Some of the annual traditions are: a corn maze race, thanksgiving and christmas parties, paintball, and a barbeque. 
          </p>
        	<h3 class="text-center">Leadership Development</h3>
        	<p>
            SHPE-UIUC works to make its members strong and capable leaders. We start early through our new member roundtable where new members get exposed to planning and leading events from our internal vice president. As members gain more experience we encourage them to take on more responsibilities  whether by choosing to lead a team of students on a project or taking on a position on the executive board. The chapter also has a PartnerSHPE program where mentors and mentees are partnered up based on interests. Furthermore, each year there are numerous workshops and a leadership retreat is held annually to help teach our members how to lead.
          </p>
        	<h3   class="text-center">Professional Development</h3>
        	<p>
            Networking and professional events are a staple of SHPE and its goal of fostering a strong STEM culture in the hispanic community. The yearly SHPE National Conference is the main professional event that our chapter participates in. Every year we have many students going and speaking with companies and professionals. Our external committee also brings in representatives from companies for workshops and plans workshops, resume critiques, and mock interviews hosted by our own members. The chapter also has connections and resources to assist members in getting internships, co-ops, job shadows, or research opportunities
