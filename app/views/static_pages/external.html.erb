        The External committee helps members develop the professional skills they need to obtain and excel at the internship, research, or full time position they want. It is in charge of building and maintaining relationships with top engineering companies, so our members can have the opportunity to interact with corporate representatives through various events. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The committee organizes many events throughout the year, such as corporate sponsored general body meetings, company socials, and professional workshops to improve resumes and interviewing skills. The committee is responsible for obtaining sponsorship for our society from different corporations. It also invites our alumni to continue to be involved in our chapter through events like the Fall Tailgate and the End of Year Banquet.
